# WordPress Plugin Development Standards
- All plugins are developed with professional WordPress best practices and excellent security standards.
- Functionality is implemented in an elegant, maintainable, and efficient manner.
- Debug logging is available upon request and should be implemented where appropriate.
- UI styling for both generator functions and wp-admin panes must be mobile-first, ensuring optimal experience on all devices.

# Contribution Workflow Standards
- Every code change or new feature must be accompanied by updated documentation (e.g., README.md, inline comments).
- All changes must be made on a feature branch and submitted via a pull request (PR) before merging to main.
- PRs should not be merged unless documentation is up to date and reviewed.
