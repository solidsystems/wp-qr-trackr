# WordPress Plugin Development Standards
- All plugins are developed with professional WordPress best practices and excellent security standards.
- Functionality is implemented in an elegant, maintainable, and efficient manner.
- Debug logging is available upon request and should be implemented where appropriate.
- UI styling for both generator functions and wp-admin panes must be mobile-first, ensuring optimal experience on all devices.

# WordPress Rewrite Rules Best Practices
- Rewrite rules must be registered on the 'init' hook to ensure WordPress's rewrite system is fully loaded.
- Never attempt to add rewrite rules before WordPress is fully initialized (e.g., during plugins_loaded).
- Always check is_admin() and wp_doing_ajax() before adding rewrite rules to prevent admin interference.
- Use add_rewrite_rule() with 'top' priority for custom URL structures to ensure they take precedence.
- Flush rewrite rules only during plugin activation/deactivation, not during normal operation.
- Register query vars using the 'query_vars' filter before adding rewrite rules.
- Use proper sanitization and escaping for all URL parameters and redirects.
- Implement proper error handling for invalid or missing rewrite parameters.
- Document all custom rewrite rules and their expected URL patterns.
- Test rewrite rules in both pretty permalinks and default permalink settings.

# Modular Setup Considerations
- Major plugin logic should be separated into modules (e.g., admin, AJAX, rewrite, debug, utility) under an `includes/` directory.
- The main plugin file should only bootstrap and require these modules, not contain business logic.
- Each module should register its own hooks and handle a single concern (separation of concerns).
- When adding new features, create a new module and require it in the main file.
- Modularization improves maintainability, scalability, testability, and aligns with WordPress best practices.
- Document the purpose of each module in the README and keep module boundaries clear.

# Module Design Principles
- Each module should have a clear, single responsibility
- Modules should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive
- Dependencies between modules should be explicit and documented
- Each module should have its own error handling and logging
- Modules should be independently testable
- Module interfaces should be stable and well-documented
- Changes to one module should not require changes to others
- Each module should have clear entry and exit points

# Module Organization
- Core functionality modules should be loaded first
- Feature modules should be loaded after core modules
- UI/Admin modules should be loaded last
- Module loading order should be documented
- Each module should declare its dependencies
- Circular dependencies between modules should be avoided
- Module initialization should be explicit and controlled

# Module Documentation
- Each module must have a header comment describing its purpose
- Module dependencies must be documented
- Module hooks and filters must be documented
- Module configuration options must be documented
- Module error handling must be documented
- Module testing requirements must be documented

# Module Testing
- Each module should have its own test suite
- Module tests should be independent of other modules
- Module tests should cover all public interfaces
- Module tests should include error cases
- Module tests should be automated
- Module test coverage should be monitored
- Module tests should be run before deployment

# Module Security
- Each module should validate its own input
- Each module should sanitize its own output
- Each module should handle its own permissions
- Each module should log security events
- Each module should have security tests
- Each module should follow WordPress security best practices

# Module Performance
- Each module should be optimized for performance
- Each module should implement caching where appropriate
- Each module should minimize database queries
- Each module should use WordPress transients for caching
- Each module should profile its performance
- Each module should document performance requirements

# Contribution Workflow Standards
- Every code change or new feature must be accompanied by updated documentation (e.g., README.md, inline comments).
- All changes must be made on a feature branch and submitted via a pull request (PR) before merging to main.
- PRs should not be merged unless documentation is up to date and reviewed.

# Environment Variable Standards
- Every time a new environment variable is added to provide dependencies or flexibility, the .env.example file must be updated to reflect the change.

# Xdebug/PECL Homebrew Fix
- Always run fix-pecl-xdebug.sh as part of the standard macOS (ARM and x86) setup to ensure Xdebug can be installed reliably with Homebrew PHP and PECL. This resolves symlink and permission issues common to both architectures.

# PR Review Automation
- Every pull request must include a summary comment detailing documentation and technical changes. If automated, use a one-line command with escaped newlines for the GitHub CLI (gh pr comment) to ensure proper formatting.

# Cursor Project Rules

# Linter Memory Limit
linter_max_memory_mb = 1024  # Set linter max memory to 1GB (1024MB) instead of the default 512MB for this project.

# WordPress PHP Indentation Rule
All PHP files (except inline alignment in arrays/comments) must use tabs for indentation, not spaces. This is especially important for WordPress plugins.

# Cursor Project Rules: WordPress Plugin Coding Standards (Enforced)

# Security & Input Handling
- All user input (e.g., $_POST, $_GET, $_SERVER) must be sanitized using wp_unslash() and the appropriate WordPress sanitization function (sanitize_text_field, esc_url_raw, intval, etc.) before use.
- Never use raw superglobals in business logic or output.

# Output Escaping
- All output (HTML, attributes, URLs, translations, etc.) must be escaped using esc_html(), esc_url(), esc_attr(), or similar before rendering to the browser.

# Yoda Conditions
- All conditionals must use Yoda conditions and strict comparison (===, !==) where possible.

# Comment Punctuation
- All inline comments must end in a full-stop (period), exclamation mark, or question mark (PHPCS Error 426).
- This applies to both single-line (//) and multi-line (/* */) inline comments.
- Examples:
  - Correct: // Initialize the database table.
  - Correct: // Why is this value negative?
  - Correct: // Database query completed successfully!
  - Incorrect: // Initialize the database table
  - Incorrect: // Set default value to null
- Exception: Code reference comments that are part of a documented pattern do not require ending punctuation.
  - Example: // ...existing code...
  - Example: // @codeCoverageIgnore
  - Example: // phpcs:ignore

# Docblocks
- All functions, classes, and files must have complete docblocks describing their purpose, parameters, and return values.

# WordPress Standards
- Use gmdate() instead of date() for timezone safety.
- Use wp_json_encode() instead of json_encode() for outputting JSON.
- Add PHPCS ignore comments for direct DB calls or debug-only error_log() only if absolutely necessary and document why.
- All enqueued assets must have resource versioning for cache busting.

# PHPCS & CI/CD
- All code must pass PHPCS with the project .phpcs.xml before merging.
- All code must pass CI/CD checks in GitHub Actions before merging.

# Review & Automation
- PR reviewers must check for these standards before approving.
- Automated tools and pre-commit hooks should enforce these rules where possible.

# Cursor Project Rule: Parallel Documentation Paths

All major documentation files (README, CONTRIBUTING, TROUBLESHOOTING, etc.) must have parallel development and production versions (e.g., README.dev.md and README.prod.md). Both versions must be kept up to date, include all shared sections, and be referenced in the main README or project landing page. This ensures clarity for both development and production users and prevents environment-specific confusion.

# Cursor Project Rule: Plugin-Based Database Migrations
Always use plugin-based migration routines for database schema changes (never require manual SQL or WP-CLI for schema updates). All schema changes must be handled automatically on plugin activation or upgrade.

# PHPCS Memory Requirement
phpcs_min_memory_mb = 1024  # PHPCS requires at least 1GB of memory for this project. For large codebases, 4GB (4096MB) is recommended.

# MCP Integration Rule
# When MCP servers are present (Context7, GitHub, DigitalOcean, etc.), Cursor and agents should use MCP APIs by default for documentation, repository, and cloud operations. This ensures consistent, secure, and agent-friendly workflows across all plugins and environments.

# Playwright Dev-Only Rule
Playwright is only installed and used in the dev Docker image (port 8080). It must not be present in production or nonprod images. Automated UI testing and screenshot capture are only supported in dev. 

# Platform-Specific Learnings and Best Practices (PHP/WordPress)
- Always restrict PHPCS to PHP files using --extensions=php in CI/CD for all plugin development.
- Use Cursor as an assistant for troubleshooting, configuration, and documentation.
- Favor modular configuration (Docker, Composer, PHPCS, etc.) for maintainability and scalability.
- Define and enforce best practices for development environments (memory, dependencies, code standards) from the start.

# PHPCS Compliance Rules

## Comment Standards
- All inline comments must end in a full-stop (period), exclamation mark, or question mark (PHPCS Error 426).
- This applies to both single-line (//) and multi-line (/* */) inline comments.
- Examples:
  - Correct: // Initialize the database table.
  - Correct: // Why is this value negative?
  - Correct: // Database query completed successfully!
  - Incorrect: // Initialize the database table
  - Incorrect: // Set default value to null
- Exception: Code reference comments that are part of a documented pattern do not require ending punctuation.
  - Example: // ...existing code...
  - Example: // @codeCoverageIgnore
  - Example: // phpcs:ignore

## Database Query Standards
- All SQL queries MUST use $wpdb->prepare() for any variables.
- Table names MUST be constructed using {$wpdb->prefix}table_name format, not string concatenation.
- Direct database queries require a phpcs:ignore comment explaining why they're necessary.
- Example:
  ```php
  // phpcs:ignore WordPress.DB.DirectDatabaseQuery.DirectQuery -- Cache implemented, direct query needed for performance.
  $result = $wpdb->get_row(
      $wpdb->prepare(
          "SELECT * FROM {$wpdb->prefix}qr_code_links WHERE post_id = %d",
          $post_id
      )
  );
  ```

## Input/Output Security
- All user input MUST be sanitized using appropriate WordPress functions:
  - Text: sanitize_text_field()
  - URLs: esc_url_raw()
  - HTML: wp_kses_post()
  - Integers: absint() or intval()
- All output MUST be escaped using appropriate WordPress functions:
  - HTML: esc_html()
  - URLs: esc_url()
  - Attributes: esc_attr()
  - JavaScript: esc_js()
- Nonce verification is required for all form submissions and AJAX requests.
- Example:
  ```php
  if ( ! isset( $_POST['nonce'] ) || ! wp_verify_nonce( sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_POST['nonce'] ) ), 'action_name' ) ) {
      wp_send_json_error( array( 'message' => __( 'Security check failed.', 'text-domain' ) ) );
      return;
  }
  ```

## Code Organization
- Each file should contain only one class, function, or feature set.
- Class files must be prefixed with 'class-'.
- Interface files must be prefixed with 'interface-'.
- Trait files must be prefixed with 'trait-'.
- File names should use lowercase and hyphens (not underscores).
- Example:
  - Correct: class-qr-code-generator.php
  - Incorrect: class_qr_code_generator.php

## Function and Variable Naming
- Function names must use lowercase letters and underscores.
- Class methods should use camelCase.
- Variables should use lowercase letters and underscores.
- Global variables and functions must be prefixed with the plugin prefix.
- Example:
  ```php
  function qr_trackr_generate_code() {
      $post_id = get_the_ID();
      $this->generateQRCode( $post_id );
  }
  ```

## Error Handling and Logging
- All database operations must check for errors.
- Use wp_error_log() for debug logging with descriptive messages.
- Always return proper error responses for AJAX requests.
- Example:
  ```php
  if ( false === $result ) {
      error_log( sprintf(
          'Database operation failed for post %d: %s',
          $post_id,
          $wpdb->last_error
      ) );
      return new WP_Error( 'db_error', __( 'Database operation failed.', 'text-domain' ) );
  }
  ```

## Code Documentation
- All functions must have complete docblocks with @since, @param, and @return tags.
- All classes must have complete docblocks with @package and @since tags.
- All files must have a file-level docblock with @package tag.
- Example:
  ```php
  /**
   * Generates a QR code for the given post.
   *
   * @since 1.0.0
   * @param int    $post_id The post ID to generate the code for.
   * @param string $size    Optional. The size of the QR code. Default 'medium'.
   * @return string|WP_Error The QR code URL or error object.
   */
  function qr_trackr_generate_code( $post_id, $size = 'medium' ) {
  ```

## Performance Considerations
- Implement caching for expensive operations.
- Use transients for temporary data storage.
- Minimize database queries by batching operations.
- Example:
  ```php
  $cache_key = 'qr_code_' . $post_id;
  $cached_value = wp_cache_get( $cache_key );
  if ( false !== $cached_value ) {
      return $cached_value;
  }
  // ... generate value ...
  wp_cache_set( $cache_key, $value, '', 300 ); // Cache for 5 minutes
  ```

## Internationalization
- All user-facing strings must use translation functions.
- Translation functions must include text domain.
- Use proper escaping with translation functions.
- Example:
  ```php
  // Correct
  echo esc_html__( 'QR Code generated successfully.', 'wp-qr-trackr' );
  
  // Incorrect
  echo 'QR Code generated successfully.';
  ```

## PHPCS Ignore Comments
- PHPCS ignore comments must include explanation.
- Only ignore specific rules, not entire files.
- Document why the rule is being ignored.
- Example:
  ```php
  // phpcs:ignore WordPress.DB.DirectDatabaseQuery.DirectQuery -- Cache implemented, atomic operation required
  ```
