# WordPress Plugin Development Standards
- All plugins are developed with professional WordPress best practices and excellent security standards.
- Functionality is implemented in an elegant, maintainable, and efficient manner.
- Debug logging is available upon request and should be implemented where appropriate.
- UI styling for both generator functions and wp-admin panes must be mobile-first, ensuring optimal experience on all devices.

# Contribution Workflow Standards
- Every code change or new feature must be accompanied by updated documentation (e.g., README.md, inline comments).
- All changes must be made on a feature branch and submitted via a pull request (PR) before merging to main.
- PRs should not be merged unless documentation is up to date and reviewed.

# Environment Variable Standards
- Every time a new environment variable is added to provide dependencies or flexibility, the .env.example file must be updated to reflect the change.

# Xdebug/PECL Homebrew Fix
- Always run fix-pecl-xdebug.sh as part of the standard macOS (ARM and x86) setup to ensure Xdebug can be installed reliably with Homebrew PHP and PECL. This resolves symlink and permission issues common to both architectures.

# PR Review Automation
- Every pull request must include a summary comment detailing documentation and technical changes. If automated, use a one-line command with escaped newlines for the GitHub CLI (gh pr comment) to ensure proper formatting.
