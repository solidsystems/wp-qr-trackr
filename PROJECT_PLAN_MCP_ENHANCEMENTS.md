# MCP Enhancements Project Plan

This plan outlines the phased implementation of advanced MCP (Model Context Protocol) capabilities for the wp-qr-trackr ecosystem and related plugins.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Tracking
- [ ] Reinstitute and automate the TODO list (update-todo-index.sh, markdown checklists)
- [ ] Integrate all MCP-related tasks into GitHub Projects for live tracking
- [ ] Ensure documentation and project plans are accessible via Context7 and GitHub MCP

## Phase 2: Agent/IDE Integration
- [ ] Auto-detect and connect to available MCP servers in dev tools/agents
- [ ] Expose MCP-powered actions in Cursor/VSCode command palette
- [ ] Provide context-aware suggestions (docs, PRs, deploys) via MCP

## Phase 3: Cross-Plugin/Project Documentation
- [ ] Centralize doc search via Context7 MCP for all plugins
- [ ] Enable doc feedback loop (suggest improvements via MCP)
- [ ] Allow plugins to register and share docs as a service

## Phase 4: Automated DevOps & Cloud Workflows
- [ ] Use DigitalOcean MCP for self-healing, scaling, and deploy automation
- [ ] Enable one-click staging/production deploys via MCP
- [ ] Integrate resource/cost monitoring into admin dashboard

## Phase 5: Advanced GitHub Automation
- [ ] Smart PR management (auto-label, assign, merge via MCP)
- [ ] Conflict resolution assistant (suggest/apply fixes via MCP)
- [ ] Security/compliance checks before merge (via MCP)

## Phase 6: Security & Access Control
- [ ] Implement fine-grained MCP API tokens/scopes
- [ ] Add audit logging for all MCP actions

## Phase 7: Custom/Internal MCP Extensions
- [ ] Build custom MCP servers for internal tools/APIs
- [ ] Enable plugin-to-plugin automation via MCP

## Phase 8: User/Contributor Experience
- [ ] Onboarding automation (setup, first PR, environment status via MCP)
- [ ] Self-service troubleshooting via MCP

## Phase 9: Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Live dashboards for environments, PRs, deploys, docs (via MCP)
- [ ] Proactive alerts/notifications for critical events
