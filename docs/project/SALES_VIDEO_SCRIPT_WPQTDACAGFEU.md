**Narrator:**

Let’s talk about the technology under the hood:

- **Languages:** PHP, JavaScript, Bash, YAML, SQL, Dockerfile, Markdown
- **Frameworks & Tools:**
  - WordPress (core, plugin APIs, admin UI)
  - PHPCS (WordPress Coding Standards)
  - Playwright (UI testing, dev only)
  - WP-CLI (automation)
  - Composer (PHP dependencies)
  - Yarn (JavaScript dependencies)
  - MySQL/MariaDB (database)
  - Git & GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
  - Docker Compose (multi-service orchestration)
  - Custom Shell Scripts (control, validation, onboarding)
- **Architecture:**
  - Modular plugin design (all business logic in `includes/`)
  - Templates for admin UI (`templates/`)
  - Asset pipeline for JS/CSS (`assets/`)
  - Automated tests (`tests/`)
  - All code and dependencies are containerized—no local PHP, Node, or Composer required.
