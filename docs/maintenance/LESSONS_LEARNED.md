# Lessons Learned & Architecture Evolution: wp-qr-trackr

## Project Overview
wp-qr-trackr is a modular, robust WordPress plugin for QR code generation and tracking. It is the author's first public open source repository, created entirely through prompt engineering and Cursor's Agent Modeâ€”**zero code was written by hand**. This document summarizes the system's architecture, how its components ("silos") interact, the project's evolution, and future improvement areas.

## System Components (Silos) & Interactions

### 1. **Core Plugin Bootstrap**
- **Responsibility:** Loads all modules, sets up plugin lifecycle (activation, deactivation, upgrade), and ensures modular boundaries.
- **Interactions:** Requires and initializes all other silos. No business logic is present here.

### 2. **Admin UI Module**
- **Responsibility:** Provides the WordPress admin interface for managing QR codes, viewing analytics, and plugin settings.
- **Interactions:** Calls into the QR code, tracking, and utility modules. Uses AJAX endpoints for dynamic features.

### 3. **QR Code Generation Module**
- **Responsibility:** Handles QR code creation, rendering, and download. Integrates with third-party libraries for QR code image generation.
- **Interactions:** Used by both admin and (optionally) frontend. Relies on utility and debug modules for error handling.

### 4. **Tracking & Analytics Module**
- **Responsibility:** Records QR code scans, tracks usage, and provides analytics to the admin UI.
- **Interactions:** Writes to and reads from the database. Exposes data to the admin UI. Uses utility and debug modules for logging and error handling.

### 5. **Rewrite Rules & Routing Module**
- **Responsibility:** Registers custom rewrite rules for pretty QR tracking URLs. Handles incoming requests and dispatches to the correct logic.
- **Interactions:** Interacts with tracking, analytics, and error handling modules. Follows WordPress best practices for rewrite rules.

### 6. **AJAX & API Module**
- **Responsibility:** Exposes AJAX endpoints for admin and frontend features (e.g., debug log retrieval, QR code generation, analytics fetch).
- **Interactions:** Used by the admin UI and potentially frontend. Calls into core, tracking, and debug modules.

### 7. **Debug & Logging Module**
- **Responsibility:** Provides robust debug logging, error reporting, and (optionally) exposes logs via AJAX for browser console inspection.
- **Interactions:** Used by all other modules for error and event logging. Can be toggled for troubleshooting.

### 8. **Utility Module**
- **Responsibility:** Shared helpers for sanitization, escaping, validation, and other cross-cutting concerns.
- **Interactions:** Used by all modules to enforce security and code quality.

### 9. **Database Migration & Activation Module**
- **Responsibility:** Handles schema changes, table creation, and upgrades automatically on plugin activation or upgrade.
- **Interactions:** Ensures all database-dependent modules have the required schema.

## Architectural Evolution & Key Learnings

- **Initial Phase:**
  - Started as a single-file plugin with basic QR code generation.
  - Quickly modularized into separate silos for admin, QR, tracking, and utility logic.
  - Adopted strict WordPress best practices (init hooks, rewrite rules, query vars, etc.).

- **Mid-Project:**
  - Introduced robust debug logging and AJAX-based troubleshooting for admin pages.
  - Added Docker-based dev and nonprod environments for safe, reproducible testing.
  - Automated build and release process with `.distignore` and `build-release.sh` for precise packaging.
  - Implemented automated release verification to prevent incomplete/broken releases.

- **Recent Improvements:**
  - Hardened security: all input sanitized, all output escaped, Yoda conditions, and strict type checks.
  - Modular database migrations: schema changes handled on activation/upgrade, never manually.
  - Documentation and CI/CD: enforced parallel dev/prod docs, automated PR and release workflows.

---

## Robustness Achieved
- **Modularization:** Each concern is isolated, making the codebase maintainable and testable.
- **Automated Testing & Verification:** Release builds are verified for required/forbidden files, reducing human error.
- **Security:** Follows WordPress and PHP best practices for input/output handling and permissions.
- **Developer Experience:** Docker environments, clear documentation, and automated scripts lower the barrier for contributors.
- **Debuggability:** AJAX-based debug log retrieval and browser console output make troubleshooting fast and user-friendly.

---

## Areas for Future Improvement
- **Automated Test Coverage:** Add PHPUnit and integration tests for all modules, not just manual/automated release checks.
- **Performance Profiling:** Add profiling and caching for analytics queries and QR generation.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Expand translation support for all UI and error messages.
- **Frontend QR Management:** Expose QR code management and analytics to authenticated frontend users.
- **Plugin Extensibility:** Provide hooks/filters for third-party extensions.
- **Community Onboarding:** Add more contributor guides, issue templates, and example PRs.

## Meta: How This Project Was Built
- **Prompt Engineering Only:** All code, scripts, and documentation were generated via prompt engineering using Cursor's Agent Mode. No code was written by hand.
- **First Public Open Source Repo:** This is the author's first public open source project, intended as a learning resource and a robust, real-world example of AI-driven software engineering.
- **Open Source Invitation:** Contributions, feedback, and improvements are welcome! See the main README for how to get involved.

## v1.0.4 (2025-06-17)

### Security & Contributor Experience
- All admin AJAX actions now use separate, localized nonces for edit, delete, and regenerate, following best security practices for WordPress plugins.
- PHPCS memory requirement is now documented for contributors (minimum 1GB, 4GB recommended for large codebases).
- These changes further harden the plugin for public/production use and improve onboarding for new contributors.

## Parallel Docker Environments: Key Learning

- The introduction of parallel Docker Compose environments (dev on 8080, nonprod on 8081) and the `launch-all-docker.sh` script was a major improvement.
- This enables:
  - Rapid, live-mount development in dev.
  - Clean, production-like release validation in nonprod (no plugin preinstalled).
  - Robust QA and modularity, as both environments are fully isolated and can run simultaneously.
- This workflow is now a best practice for all future plugin projects.

## CI/CD Workflow Evolution: Major Achievement

### Initial Challenges
- **WordPress Test Suite Integration:** Initially struggled with WordPress test environment setup in containers
- **Database Compatibility:** MySQL Docker image lacked ARM64 support, causing build failures on macOS
- **PHPUnit Detection:** Inconsistent PHPUnit location and installation across environments
- **Bootstrap File Issues:** WordPress functions called before WordPress was loaded

### Key Fixes Implemented

#### 1. WordPress Bootstrap Fix
**Problem:** `Call to undefined function add_action()` error in PHPUnit tests.

**Root Cause:** Bootstrap file called WordPress functions before WordPress was loaded.

**Solution:** Reordered bootstrap file to load WordPress first:
```php
// CORRECT ORDER:
require $_tests_dir . '/includes/bootstrap.php';  // Load WordPress first
add_action( 'muplugins_loaded', '_manually_load_plugin' );  // Then call WordPress functions
```

**Learning:** Always ensure WordPress core is loaded before calling any WordPress functions in test environments.

#### 2. Database Host Configuration
**Problem:** WordPress test suite couldn't connect to database using `localhost`.

**Root Cause:** CI environment uses Docker services, not localhost.

**Solution:** Updated to use Docker service name:
```bash
# CORRECT:
bash scripts/install-wp-tests.sh wpdb wpuser wppass db latest

# WRONG:
bash scripts/install-wp-tests.sh wpdb wpuser wppass localhost latest
```

**Learning:** Containerized environments require service-based networking, not localhost references.

#### 3. MariaDB Integration
**Problem:** MySQL image not compatible with ARM64 architecture.

**Root Cause:** MySQL Docker image lacks ARM64 support.

**Solution:** Switched to MariaDB for cross-platform compatibility:
```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: mariadb:10.5  # ARM64 compatible
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wpdb
      MYSQL_USER: wpuser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: wppass
```

**Learning:** Always test Docker images on target architectures, especially for CI/CD pipelines.

#### 4. Robust PHPUnit Detection
**Problem:** `./vendor/bin/phpunit: No such file or directory` error.

**Root Cause:** Inconsistent PHPUnit installation and location.

**Solution:** Implemented robust detection with fallbacks:
```bash
if [ -f "./vendor/bin/phpunit" ]; then
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit
elif [ -f "/usr/src/app/vendor/bin/phpunit" ]; then
    /usr/src/app/vendor/bin/phpunit
else
    composer install --no-interaction
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit
fi
```

**Learning:** Always provide fallback mechanisms for dependency detection in CI environments.

### CI/CD Best Practices Established

#### 1. Local Testing First
- **Rule:** Always test CI workflow locally before pushing
- **Command:** `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.ci.yml run --rm ci-runner`
- **Benefit:** Catches issues before they reach GitHub Actions

#### 2. Descriptive Commit Messages
- **Rule:** Use `ci:` prefix for CI-related changes
- **Example:** `ci: fix WordPress bootstrap file to load WordPress before calling add_action`
- **Benefit:** Clear history of CI improvements and fixes

#### 3. Comprehensive Documentation
- **Rule:** Document all CI fixes and troubleshooting steps
- **Files:** `docs/development/CI_CD_WORKFLOW.md`, troubleshooting guides
- **Benefit:** Future contributors can quickly resolve similar issues

#### 4. Container Isolation
- **Rule:** All CI operations run in isolated containers
- **Benefit:** Consistent environment across all contributors and platforms

### Technical Achievements

#### Containerized Testing Environment
- **Self-contained:** No local PHP, Composer, or Node.js required
- **Cross-platform:** Works on ARM64 and x86 architectures
- **Reproducible:** Identical environment for all contributors
