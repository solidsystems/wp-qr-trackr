# Cursor Quick Reference

Essential commands and prompts for WP QR Trackr development with Cursor.

## üö® Critical Environment Configurations (MANDATORY)

### Setup Commands
```bash
# Development environment (port 8080)
./scripts/setup-wordpress.sh dev

# Testing environment (port 8081)
./scripts/setup-wordpress.sh nonprod

# Playwright testing environment (port 8087)
./scripts/setup-wordpress.sh playwright
```

### Manual Configuration (if setup script fails)
```bash
# Fix upgrade directory permissions
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml exec --user root wordpress-dev chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wp-content/upgrade
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml exec --user root wordpress-dev chmod 775 /var/www/html/wp-content/upgrade

# Set pretty permalinks (REQUIRED for QR redirects)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml exec wpcli-dev wp rewrite structure '/%postname%/' --path=/var/www/html
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml exec wpcli-dev wp rewrite flush --hard --path=/var/www/html

# Verify plugin activation
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml exec wpcli-dev wp plugin list --name=wp-qr-trackr
```

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check plugin status
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml exec wpcli-dev wp plugin list --name=wp-qr-trackr

# Check permalink structure
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml exec wpcli-dev wp option get permalink_structure --path=/var/www/html

# Check directory permissions
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml exec wordpress-dev ls -la /var/www/html/wp-content/upgrade
```

```

## üìã Checklists

### Pre-Development Checklist
- [ ] Fork wp-qr-trackr repository
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Define plugin requirements clearly
- [ ] Create project plan with TODO system
- [ ] Set up GitHub Projects integration

### Development Checklist
- [ ] Transform codebase to plugin identity
- [ ] Implement features incrementally
- [ ] Write tests for all functionality
- [ ] Maintain PHPCS compliance
- [ ] Update documentation continuously

### Pre-Release Checklist
- [ ] Run comprehensive testing
- [ ] Verify security implementations
- [ ] Check performance optimization
- [ ] Validate documentation completeness
- [ ] Test deployment process

## üí° Best Practices

### Effective Prompting
- **Be specific** about context and requirements
- **Reference existing patterns** in the codebase
- **Request incremental development** rather than large changes
- **Ask for multiple options** when appropriate
- **Validate architecture** before implementation

### Quality Maintenance
- **Run PHPCS** after each major change
- **Execute tests** frequently during development
- **Update documentation** as features are completed
- **Maintain the TODO system** throughout development
- **Review security** for every feature

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Scope creep** - Define clear boundaries
- **Ignoring WordPress standards** - Follow best practices
- **Neglecting testing** - Write tests as you develop
- **Poor documentation** - Document as you build
- **Security shortcuts** - Implement security from the start
