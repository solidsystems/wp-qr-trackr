# Troubleshooting & FAQ

This guide covers common issues and solutions for the QR Trackr plugin and template. If you run into a problem not listed here, please open an issue or see CONTRIBUTING.md for more help.

## Xdebug/PECL Issues
- Run `fix-pecl-xdebug.sh` to resolve most Xdebug installation problems on macOS (ARM/x86).
- Ensure Homebrew and PECL are up to date.

## Database/Logging Issues
- Double-check your `.env` file for correct DigitalOcean PostgreSQL and OpenSearch credentials.
- Confirm your database is accessible from your local or CI environment.
- Review logs in OpenSearch for error details.

## Docker Issues
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running and ports are not in use by other services.
- Rebuild containers with `docker compose build --no-cache` if you encounter persistent issues.

## Environment & Dependency Issues
- Use `yarn setup:ci` to reinstall all dependencies and Husky hooks.
- Ensure `.env` and `.env.example` are up to date and match your environment.

## CI/CD & GitHub Actions Issues

### PHP CodeSniffer Path Error: "No such file or directory"
**Error:** GitHub Actions workflow fails with `/vendor/bin/phpcs: No such file or directory` when running from the plugin directory.

**Cause:** The workflow changes to the plugin directory (`wp-content/plugins/wp-qr-trackr/`) but uses an incorrect relative path to access the `phpcs` binary in the repository root.

**Solution:** Update the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to use the correct relative path:
- **Wrong:** `../../vendor/bin/phpcs` (only goes up 2 levels)
- **Correct:** `../../../vendor/bin/phpcs` (goes up 3 levels: plugin → plugins → wp-content → root)

**Directory Structure:**
```
root/
├── vendor/bin/phpcs          # Root-level Composer dependencies
└── wp-content/
    └── plugins/
        └── wp-qr-trackr/     # Plugin directory (3 levels deep from root)
```

**Fixed workflow step example:**
```yaml
- name: PHP_CodeSniffer (WordPress)
  run: |
    cd wp-content/plugins/wp-qr-trackr
    ../../../vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=../../../.phpcs.xml --report=full --extensions=php .
```

**Note:** Also ensure you're using:
- `--standard=../../../.phpcs.xml` (correct config file path with leading dot)
- `--extensions=php` (to avoid memory issues with large JS files in node_modules)

## PHPCS Warnings Allowed in Pre-commit and CI/CD

**Note:** As of the latest workflow update, both the pre-commit hook and the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline are configured to allow PHPCS warnings (such as justified direct database calls with PHPCS ignore comments) and only block on errors. This is achieved by running PHPCS with `--warning-severity=0` in both local and CI workflows. Only true errors will block commits and merges; warnings will be reported but will not fail the workflow.

## Differences Between Local Pre-commit Linting and GitHub Actions

Local pre-commit linting (via Husky/Docker) and GitHub Actions (GHA) CI/CD workflows are both used to enforce code quality, but differences in environment, configuration, and file paths can sometimes cause discrepancies in results.

### Why Results May Differ
- **Environment:** Local hooks run in your dev environment (often via Docker), while GHA runs in a clean GitHub VM.
- **Paths:** Local scripts may use relative paths that work on your machine but not in CI. GHA requires paths relative to the workflow's working directory.
- **Config:** Both use `.phpcs.xml`, but if the path is wrong in CI, the wrong ruleset/files may be checked.
- **Exclusions:** Test files, `node_modules`, and other non-source files are excluded from PHPCS in both local and CI runs, but misconfigured paths can cause these to be included/excluded incorrectly.

### What Was Done to Fix This Project
- **PHPCS Path Fixes:** The GHA workflow was updated to use the correct path to the `phpcs` binary and config file, matching the local setup (e.g., `../../../vendor/bin/phpcs`).
- **Warning Handling:** Both local and CI runs now use `--warning-severity=0` to allow warnings but block on errors only.
- **Exclusions:** `.phpcs.xml` excludes test files, `node_modules`, and other non-source code from linting in both environments.
- **Documentation:** This section and the README were updated to help contributors understand and resolve discrepancies.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- Double-check the PHPCS version and config file used in both environments.
- Ensure you are running the same commands as the CI workflow (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- Reinstall dependencies and hooks with `yarn setup:ci`.
- If you see different results locally and in CI, review this section and the README for guidance.

## General Contribution Questions
- All standards and automation are described in the main README. The CI/CD pipeline enforces best practices so you can focus on building features.
- For anything not covered here, see `CONTRIBUTING.md` or open an issue.

## Final Few Steps: Remaining PHPCS/Linter Issues

## Final Compliance Stage: Remaining PHPCS Issues and Fixes

Congratulations! The codebase is now highly compliant with WordPress Coding Standards, with all major architectural, security, and documentation issues addressed. The plugin is robust, maintainable, and secure. However, a final sweep by PHPCS has revealed a handful of remaining issues that must be resolved for 100% compliance.

Below is a categorized checklist of the remaining issues, with file references and notes for each. Use this as a guide for the last round of compliance work.

### 1. SQL Placeholders and Table Name Interpolation
- **Problem:** Some SQL queries still use interpolated variables for table names inside `$wpdb->prepare()`, or do not use placeholders for values.
- **Files:**
  - `qr-code.php`
  - `qr-trackr.php`
  - `includes/class-qr-trackr-list-table.php`
  - `includes/module-admin.php`
  - `includes/module-ajax.php`
  - `includes/module-qr.php`
  - `includes/module-rewrite.php`
  - `includes/module-utility.php`
- **Fix:** Always construct table names outside of `prepare()`, and use placeholders for all values. Example:
  ```php
  $table = $wpdb->prefix . 'my_table';
  $wpdb->get_var( $wpdb->prepare( 'SELECT * FROM `' . $table . '` WHERE id = %d', $id ) );
  ```

### 2. Output Escaping
- **Problem:** Some output is not properly escaped using WordPress functions.
- **Files:**
  - `qr-trackr.php`
  - `includes/class-qr-trackr-list-table.php`
  - `includes/module-admin.php`
- **Fix:** Wrap all output in `esc_html()`, `esc_url()`, `esc_attr()`, etc., as appropriate.

### 3. Inline Comment Punctuation
- **Problem:** Inline comments do not always end in full-stops, exclamation marks, or question marks.
- **Files:**
  - `qr-code.php`
  - `qr-trackr.php`
  - `includes/module-utility.php`
- **Fix:** Update all inline comments to end with proper punctuation.

### 4. Nonce and Input Sanitization
- **Problem:** Some user input is not unslashed or sanitized before use, and some form actions lack nonce verification.
- **Files:**
  - `qr-trackr.php`
- **Fix:** Always use `wp_unslash()` and appropriate sanitization functions on all user input, and verify nonces for all form submissions.

### 5. Resource Versioning for Enqueued Assets
- **Problem:** Some calls to `wp_enqueue_style()` and `wp_enqueue_script()` do not set a version parameter.
- **Files:**
  - `qr-trackr.php`
- **Fix:** Add a version constant or string to all enqueued assets for cache busting.

### 6. File/Class Naming Conventions
- **Problem:** Some class files do not match the class name with the `class-` prefix.
- **Files:**
  - `includes/class-qr-trackr-cli.php`
  - `includes/class-qr-trackr-list-table.php`
- **Fix:** Rename files to match the class name with the `class-` prefix (e.g., `class-qr-trackr-cli-command.php`).

### 7. Docblocks and Comment Styles
- **Problem:** Some functions or files are missing docblocks, or use incorrect comment styles.
- **Files:**
  - `qr-code.php`
  - `qr-trackr.php`
  - `includes/class-qr-trackr-list-table.php`
  - `includes/module-utility.php`
- **Fix:** Add or correct docblocks for all files, classes, and functions.

### 8. Discouraged Functions and Practices
- **Problem:** Use of `error_log()`, direct DB schema changes, and other discouraged functions in production code.
- **Files:**
  - `includes/module-utility.php`
- **Fix:** Suppress with PHPCS comments and ensure these are only used for debugging or migration, not in production logic.

### 9. [DONE] qr-code.php: SQL query in `qr_trackr_generate_qr_image_for_link` now uses single quotes and constructs the table name outside of `prepare()`. Only values are passed as placeholders. Table name is safely constructed from `$wpdb->prefix` and a static string.

### 10. [DONE] includes/module-ajax.php: SQL queries now construct table names outside of `prepare()` and use placeholders only for values. Table names are clearly marked as safe with comments.

**Action:**
Work through each category and file, applying the recommended fixes. Re-run PHPCS after each round to confirm compliance. Once all issues are resolved, the plugin will be fully standards-compliant and ready for production or release.

## Compliance Checklist Reference

A full WordPress Coding Standards compliance checklist is now maintained in the [README.md](./README.md). Please refer to that section for the latest status and any remaining minor issues before release or PR merge.

## Parallel Docker Environments & Troubleshooting

This project supports running both dev (8080) and nonprod (8081) WordPress environments in parallel using Docker Compose. Use `./scripts/launch-all-docker.sh` to start both environments with full isolation.

### Common Issues
- **Port Conflicts:**
  - If you see errors about ports 8080 or 8081 being in use, run `lsof -i :8080` or `lsof -i :8081` to find and stop the conflicting process.
- **Orphaned Containers:**
  - The launch script uses `--remove-orphans` to clean up old containers. If you see unexpected containers, run `docker compose -p wpqrdev down` and `docker compose -p wpqrnonprod down`.
- **Resetting Environments:**
  - To reset dev: `./scripts/reset-docker.sh dev`
  - To reset nonprod: `./scripts/reset-docker.sh nonprod`
- **Accessing Environments:**
  - Dev: http://localhost:8080
  - Nonprod: http://localhost:8081

### Best Practices
- Always use the launch script for parallel environments.
- Only upload release ZIPs to nonprod; dev is for live code.
- If in doubt, stop all containers and relaunch.
