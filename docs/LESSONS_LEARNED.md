# Lessons Learned & Architecture Evolution: wp-qr-trackr

## Project Overview
wp-qr-trackr is a modular, robust WordPress plugin for QR code generation and tracking. It is the author's first public open source repository, created entirely through prompt engineering and Cursor's Agent Modeâ€”**zero code was written by hand**. This document summarizes the system's architecture, how its components ("silos") interact, the project's evolution, and future improvement areas.

## System Components (Silos) & Interactions

### 1. **Core Plugin Bootstrap**
- **Responsibility:** Loads all modules, sets up plugin lifecycle (activation, deactivation, upgrade), and ensures modular boundaries.
- **Interactions:** Requires and initializes all other silos. No business logic is present here.

### 2. **Admin UI Module**
- **Responsibility:** Provides the WordPress admin interface for managing QR codes, viewing analytics, and plugin settings.
- **Interactions:** Calls into the QR code, tracking, and utility modules. Uses AJAX endpoints for dynamic features.

### 3. **QR Code Generation Module**
- **Responsibility:** Handles QR code creation, rendering, and download. Integrates with third-party libraries for QR code image generation.
- **Interactions:** Used by both admin and (optionally) frontend. Relies on utility and debug modules for error handling.

### 4. **Tracking & Analytics Module**
- **Responsibility:** Records QR code scans, tracks usage, and provides analytics to the admin UI.
- **Interactions:** Writes to and reads from the database. Exposes data to the admin UI. Uses utility and debug modules for logging and error handling.

### 5. **Rewrite Rules & Routing Module**
- **Responsibility:** Registers custom rewrite rules for pretty QR tracking URLs. Handles incoming requests and dispatches to the correct logic.
- **Interactions:** Interacts with tracking, analytics, and error handling modules. Follows WordPress best practices for rewrite rules.

### 6. **AJAX & API Module**
- **Responsibility:** Exposes AJAX endpoints for admin and frontend features (e.g., debug log retrieval, QR code generation, analytics fetch).
- **Interactions:** Used by the admin UI and potentially frontend. Calls into core, tracking, and debug modules.

### 7. **Debug & Logging Module**
- **Responsibility:** Provides robust debug logging, error reporting, and (optionally) exposes logs via AJAX for browser console inspection.
- **Interactions:** Used by all other modules for error and event logging. Can be toggled for troubleshooting.

### 8. **Utility Module**
- **Responsibility:** Shared helpers for sanitization, escaping, validation, and other cross-cutting concerns.
- **Interactions:** Used by all modules to enforce security and code quality.

### 9. **Database Migration & Activation Module**
- **Responsibility:** Handles schema changes, table creation, and upgrades automatically on plugin activation or upgrade.
- **Interactions:** Ensures all database-dependent modules have the required schema.

## Architectural Evolution & Key Learnings

- **Initial Phase:**
  - Started as a single-file plugin with basic QR code generation.
  - Quickly modularized into separate silos for admin, QR, tracking, and utility logic.
  - Adopted strict WordPress best practices (init hooks, rewrite rules, query vars, etc.).

- **Mid-Project:**
  - Introduced robust debug logging and AJAX-based troubleshooting for admin pages.
  - Added Docker-based dev and nonprod environments for safe, reproducible testing.
  - Automated build and release process with `.distignore` and `build-release.sh` for precise packaging.
  - Implemented automated release verification to prevent incomplete/broken releases.

- **Recent Improvements:**
  - Hardened security: all input sanitized, all output escaped, Yoda conditions, and strict type checks.
  - Modular database migrations: schema changes handled on activation/upgrade, never manually.
  - Documentation and CI/CD: enforced parallel dev/prod docs, automated PR and release workflows.

## Robustness Achieved
- **Modularization:** Each concern is isolated, making the codebase maintainable and testable.
- **Automated Testing & Verification:** Release builds are verified for required/forbidden files, reducing human error.
- **Security:** Follows WordPress and PHP best practices for input/output handling and permissions.
- **Developer Experience:** Docker environments, clear documentation, and automated scripts lower the barrier for contributors.
- **Debuggability:** AJAX-based debug log retrieval and browser console output make troubleshooting fast and user-friendly.

---

## Areas for Future Improvement
- **Automated Test Coverage:** Add PHPUnit and integration tests for all modules, not just manual/automated release checks.
- **Performance Profiling:** Add profiling and caching for analytics queries and QR generation.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Expand translation support for all UI and error messages.
- **Frontend QR Management:** Expose QR code management and analytics to authenticated frontend users.
- **Plugin Extensibility:** Provide hooks/filters for third-party extensions.
- **Community Onboarding:** Add more contributor guides, issue templates, and example PRs.

## Meta: How This Project Was Built
- **Prompt Engineering Only:** All code, scripts, and documentation were generated via prompt engineering using Cursor's Agent Mode. No code was written by hand.
- **First Public Open Source Repo:** This is the author's first public open source project, intended as a learning resource and a robust, real-world example of AI-driven software engineering.
- **Open Source Invitation:** Contributions, feedback, and improvements are welcome! See the main README for how to get involved.

## v1.0.4 (2025-06-17)

### Security & Contributor Experience
- All admin AJAX actions now use separate, localized nonces for edit, delete, and regenerate, following best security practices for WordPress plugins.
- PHPCS memory requirement is now documented for contributors (minimum 1GB, 4GB recommended for large codebases).
- These changes further harden the plugin for public/production use and improve onboarding for new contributors.

## Parallel Docker Environments: Key Learning

- The introduction of parallel Docker Compose environments (dev on 8080, nonprod on 8081) and the `launch-all-docker.sh` script was a major improvement.
- This enables:
  - Rapid, live-mount development in dev.
  - Clean, production-like release validation in nonprod (no plugin preinstalled).
  - Robust QA and modularity, as both environments are fully isolated and can run simultaneously.
- This workflow is now a best practice for all future plugin projects.
