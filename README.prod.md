- DigitalOcean App Platform account
- WordPress-compatible hosting
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

### Production Setup Steps
1. **Clone the repository and build the plugin as per release instructions.**
2. **Deploy WordPress to DigitalOcean App Platform or your production host.**
3. **Upload the built plugin zip via the WordPress admin or deploy as part of your CI/CD pipeline.**
4. **Configure environment variables and secrets in the DigitalOcean App Platform dashboard.**
5. **Ensure debug mode is disabled in production.**

## Production Deployment & Configuration

**Recommended `wp-config.php` settings for production:**

```php
// Production configuration example

define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', false );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );

define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true ); // Prevents file editing from the admin

define( 'FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true ); // Enforce SSL for admin

// Set database and other secrets via environment variables (recommended for DigitalOcean App Platform)
define( 'DB_NAME', getenv('DB_NAME') );
define( 'DB_USER', getenv('DB_USER') );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', getenv('DB_PASSWORD') );
define( 'DB_HOST', getenv('DB_HOST') );
// ... other environment-based config ...
```

> **Important:**
> - Do **not** include `wp-config-dev.php` or enable debug mode in production.
> - Ensure all secrets (database credentials, salts, etc.) are set via environment variables in the DigitalOcean App Platform dashboard.
> - Always use SSL and restrict file editing in the admin for security.
> - Monitor logs using DigitalOcean's built-in logging or forward to a managed OpenSearch instance as described in the infrastructure section.
