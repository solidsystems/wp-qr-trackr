## Project Overview

**QR Trackr** is a WordPress plugin for generating and tracking QR codes for posts, pages, and custom URLs. This repository also serves as a robust template for building any modern WordPress plugin.

**Key Features:**
- Modular, scalable plugin structure
- Secure, maintainable, and extensible codebase
- Hooks/filters for free/pro separation
- Mobile-first, accessible admin UI
- Automated setup and testing
- Comprehensive PHPUnit test suite
- DigitalOcean App Platform compatibility
- Example project plans and automation scripts

## Quick Start / Onboarding (Production)

### Prerequisites
- DigitalOcean App Platform account
- WordPress-compatible hosting
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

### Production Setup Steps
1. **Clone the repository and build the plugin as per release instructions.**
2. **Deploy WordPress to DigitalOcean App Platform or your production host.**
3. **Upload the built plugin zip via the WordPress admin or deploy as part of your CI/CD pipeline.**
4. **Configure environment variables and secrets in the DigitalOcean App Platform dashboard.**
5. **Ensure debug mode is disabled in production.**

### CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses a fully containerized CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions to ensure code quality, correctness, and adherence to standards. The workflow automatically runs on every push or pull request to the `main` branch or any `feature/**` branch.

**Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Process Overview:**

1.  **Build CI Container:** The workflow first builds a dedicated Docker container using `Dockerfile.ci`. This container includes WordPress, PHP, Node.js, and all necessary dependencies to run the checks.
2.  **Run Checks:** It then executes the `ci.sh` script inside the container, which performs the following steps:
    *   **Wait for Database:** Ensures the `db-nonprod` service is healthy and ready for connections.
    *   **JS/CSS Linting:** Runs `yarn eslint` and `yarn stylelint` against the plugin's files from the WordPress root directory.
    *   **PHP Testing Setup:** Changes into the plugin's directory (`wp-content/plugins/wp-qr-trackr`) and runs the `scripts/install-wp-tests.sh` script to set up the WordPress test environment and database.
    *   **PHPCS:** Runs `./vendor/bin/phpcs .` to check for PHP coding standards violations.
    *   **PHPUnit:** Runs the full PHPUnit test suite using `./vendor/bin/phpunit`.

This containerized approach guarantees a consistent and reproducible testing environment, eliminating "it works on my machine" issues and ensuring that all checks run in an environment identical to production.

### Modular Linting & Formatting Configuration

To ensure code quality and consistency across all contributors and environments, this project uses a modular, extensible lint-staged configuration. This setup automatically lints and formats all relevant file types before each commit, using the right tool for each language or format. 

**Key points:**
- No `cd` commands are used in config files, avoiding path confusion and automation issues.
- All linting/formatting is run from the project root, ensuring compatibility with Husky, lint-staged, and CI/CD.
- The configuration is easily extendable for new file types or tools.
- This approach enforces standards, reduces review friction, and prevents common pitfalls in cross-platform and modular setups.

**Current `.lintstagedrc.json` config:**
```json
{
  "*.js": "eslint --fix",
  "*.jsx": "eslint --fix",
  "*.ts": "eslint --fix",
  "*.tsx": "eslint --fix",
  "*.php": "phpcbf",
  "*.css": "stylelint --fix",
  "*.scss": "stylelint --fix",
  "*.json": "prettier --write",
  "*.md": "prettier --write",
  "*.yml": "prettier --write",
  "*.yaml": "prettier --write"
}
```

**What each tool does:**
- `eslint --fix`: Lints and auto-formats JavaScript, JSX, TypeScript, and TSX files.
- `phpcbf`: Applies WordPress and project PHP coding standards automatically.
- `stylelint --fix`: Lints and auto-formats CSS and SCSS files.
- `prettier --write`: Formats JSON, Markdown, and YAML files for consistency.

**Significance:**
- **Reliability:** Avoids automation pitfalls (like infinite loops from `cd` in configs).
- **Consistency:** All code and docs are auto-formatted before commit.
- **Modularity:** Easy to add new file types or tools as the project grows.
- **Cross-platform:** Works on macOS, Linux, and CI/CD without modification.

See `scripts/.lintstagedrc.json` for the authoritative config. Update this file if you add new file types or want to change linting/formatting tools.
