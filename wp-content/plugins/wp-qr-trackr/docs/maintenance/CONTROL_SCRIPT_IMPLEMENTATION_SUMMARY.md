# Control Script Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of control script enforcement across the WP QR Trackr project, ensuring that all operations use standardized control scripts instead of direct Docker commands.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Control Scripts Created

#### `scripts/wp-operations.sh`
- **Purpose**: Standardized WordPress CLI operations through Docker containers
- **Usage**: `./scripts/wp-operations.sh [dev|nonprod] [command] [args...]`
- **Features**:
  - Environment validation
  - Container health checks
  - Automatic container startup if needed
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Built-in help system

#### `scripts/debug.sh`
- **Purpose**: Standardized debugging operations through Docker containers
- **Usage**: `./scripts/debug.sh [dev|nonprod|ci] [command]`
- **Features**:
  - Container health diagnostics
  - WordPress status checks
  - Log analysis tools
  - Performance monitoring
  - Error troubleshooting

### 2. Enhanced Existing Scripts

#### `scripts/manage-containers.sh`
- **Added WordPress-specific commands**:
  - `wp-install` - Install WordPress
  - `wp-status` - Check WordPress status
  - `wp-reset` - Reset WordPress installation
  - `wp-plugin-status` - Check plugin status
- **Enhanced error handling and validation**
- **Improved logging and user feedback**

#### `Makefile`
- **Added new targets**:
  - `wp-dev` / `wp-nonprod` - WordPress operations
  - `debug-dev` / `debug-nonprod` - Debug operations
  - `containers-dev` / `containers-nonprod` - Container management
- **Standardized command patterns**
- **Improved help documentation**

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

#### `docs/maintenance/CONTROL_SCRIPT_ENFORCEMENT.md`
- **Strategy and implementation plan**
- **Usage guidelines and best practices**
- **Migration guide from direct commands**
- **Enforcement mechanisms**

#### `docs/dev-guide/COMMAND_REFERENCE.md`
- **Complete command reference**
- **Quick reference guide**
- **Before/after examples**
- **Troubleshooting guide**

#### `docs/maintenance/CONTROL_SCRIPT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- **Implementation summary**
- **Feature overview**
- **Testing results**
- **Future enhancements**

### 4. Project Standards Updates

#### `.cursorrules`
- **Added control script enforcement guidelines**
- **Mandatory control script usage**
- **Prohibited direct Docker commands**
- **Standardized command patterns**

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

- Consistent environment across all developers

### 2. Consistency ✅
- All developers use the same standardized commands
- Reduced configuration drift
- Predictable behavior across environments

### 3. Error Prevention ✅
- Built-in validation and error handling
- Automatic container health checks
- Comprehensive error messages and troubleshooting

### 4. Maintainability ✅
- Centralized command logic
- Easy to update and extend
- Clear usage examples and documentation

### 5. Documentation ✅
- Comprehensive guides for all operations
- Clear migration path from old commands
- Best practices and troubleshooting guides

## Usage Examples

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Start development environment
./scripts/setup-wordpress.sh dev

# Start nonprod environment
./scripts/setup-wordpress.sh nonprod

# Enhanced setup with auto-recovery
./scripts/setup-wordpress-enhanced.sh dev
```

### WordPress Operations
```bash
# Plugin operations
./scripts/wp-operations.sh dev plugin list
./scripts/wp-operations.sh dev plugin activate wp-qr-trackr

# Core operations
./scripts/wp-operations.sh dev core is-installed
./scripts/wp-operations.sh dev core version

# Option operations
./scripts/wp-operations.sh dev option get permalink_structure
./scripts/wp-operations.sh dev option update blogname "New Site Name"
```

### Debug Operations
```bash
# Health checks
./scripts/debug.sh dev health
./scripts/debug.sh nonprod health

# WordPress diagnostics
./scripts/debug.sh dev wordpress
./scripts/debug.sh dev diagnose

# Log analysis
./scripts/debug.sh dev logs
./scripts/debug.sh dev logs --follow
```

### Container Management
```bash
# WordPress installation
./scripts/manage-containers.sh wp-install dev
./scripts/manage-containers.sh wp-reset dev

# Plugin management
./scripts/manage-containers.sh wp-plugin-status dev
./scripts/manage-containers.sh wp-status dev

# Container operations
./scripts/manage-containers.sh start dev
./scripts/manage-containers.sh health dev
./scripts/manage-containers.sh restart dev
```
