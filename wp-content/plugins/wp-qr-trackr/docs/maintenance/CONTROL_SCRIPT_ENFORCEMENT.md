# Control Script Enforcement Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for ensuring that control scripts are used wherever possible, minimizing local command usage and maintaining dependency minimization as outlined in the Claude prompt engineering guidelines.

## Current State Analysis

### âœ… Well-Implemented Control Scripts

The project already has excellent control script coverage in several areas:

1. **Environment Management**
   - `scripts/setup-wordpress.sh` - WordPress environment setup
   - `scripts/setup-wordpress-enhanced.sh` - Enhanced setup with auto-recovery
   - `scripts/manage-containers.sh` - Comprehensive container management

2. **Development Workflow**
   - `scripts/validate.sh` - Code validation and testing
   - `Makefile` - Standardized build targets
   - `scripts/create-pr.sh` - Automated PR creation

3. **Testing and CI/CD**
   - `scripts/check-onboarding.sh` - Environment validation
   - `scripts/fix-phpcs.sh` - Code style fixes
   - `scripts/update-release-notes.sh` - Release management

### ðŸ”§ Areas for Enhancement

The following areas have been identified for control script implementation:

1. **WordPress CLI Operations**
   - Direct `docker exec` commands for WordPress CLI
   - Need standardized wrapper scripts

2. **Debug Operations**
   - Manual container health checks
   - Direct log access commands
   - Need centralized debugging tools

3. **Database Operations**
   - Direct database access commands
   - Need standardized database management scripts

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: WordPress Operations (âœ… COMPLETED)

**New Control Scripts:**
- `scripts/wp-operations.sh` - Standardized WordPress CLI operations
- Enhanced `scripts/manage-containers.sh` with WordPress-specific commands

**Features:**
- Environment validation
- Container health checks
- Automatic container startup if needed
- Comprehensive error handling
- Built-in help system

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# WordPress plugin operations
./scripts/wp-operations.sh dev plugin list
./scripts/wp-operations.sh dev plugin activate wp-qr-trackr

# WordPress core operations
./scripts/wp-operations.sh dev core is-installed
./scripts/wp-operations.sh dev core version

# WordPress option operations
./scripts/wp-operations.sh dev option get permalink_structure
./scripts/wp-operations.sh dev option update blogname "New Site Name"
```

### Phase 2: Debug Operations (âœ… COMPLETED)

**New Control Scripts:**
- `scripts/debug.sh` - Standardized debugging operations

**Features:**
- Container health diagnostics
- WordPress status checks
- Log analysis tools
- Performance monitoring
- Error troubleshooting

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Health checks
./scripts/debug.sh dev health
./scripts/debug.sh nonprod health

# WordPress diagnostics
./scripts/debug.sh dev wordpress
./scripts/debug.sh dev diagnose

# Log analysis
./scripts/debug.sh dev logs
./scripts/debug.sh dev logs --follow
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Container Management (âœ… COMPLETED)

**Enhanced Features:**
- WordPress-specific container commands
- Automated WordPress installation
- Plugin status management
- Database operations

**New Commands:**
```bash
# WordPress installation
./scripts/manage-containers.sh wp-install dev
./scripts/manage-containers.sh wp-reset dev

# Plugin management
./scripts/manage-containers.sh wp-plugin-status dev
./scripts/manage-containers.sh wp-status dev
```

## Documentation Standards

### Command Reference Guide

A comprehensive command reference guide has been created at `docs/dev-guide/COMMAND_REFERENCE.md` that includes:

1. **Quick Reference** - Common commands at a glance
2. **Environment Setup** - Complete environment initialization
3. **WordPress Operations** - All WordPress CLI operations
4. **Debug Operations** - Troubleshooting and diagnostics
5. **Container Management** - Docker container operations
6. **Development Workflow** - Standard development tasks
7. **Testing and Validation** - Code quality and testing
8. **Release Management** - Deployment and release tasks

### Migration Guide

The implementation includes a migration guide to help developers transition from direct Docker commands to control scripts:

1. **Before/After Examples** - Side-by-side command comparisons
2. **Common Use Cases** - Real-world scenarios
3. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
4. **Best Practices** - Recommended workflows

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. Documentation Updates

- All documentation now shows control script usage
- Direct Docker commands are no longer documented
- Examples use standardized control scripts

### 2. Makefile Integration

The Makefile has been enhanced with new targets:

```makefile
# WordPress operations
wp-dev:          # WordPress operations for dev environment
wp-nonprod:      # WordPress operations for nonprod environment

# Debug operations
debug-dev:       # Debug operations for dev environment
debug-nonprod:   # Debug operations for nonprod environment

# Container management
containers-dev:  # Container management for dev environment
containers-nonprod: # Container management for nonprod environment
```

### 3. Project Standards

The `.cursorrules` file has been updated with control script enforcement guidelines:

- Mandatory control script usage
- Prohibited direct Docker commands
- Standardized command patterns
- Error handling requirements

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Dependency Minimization âœ…
- No local PHP, Composer, Node.js, or other tools required
- All operations work through Docker containers
- Consistent environment across all developers

### 2. Consistency âœ…
- All developers use the same standardized commands
- Reduced configuration drift
- Predictable behavior across environments

### 3. Error Prevention âœ…
- Built-in validation and error handling
- Automatic container health checks
- Comprehensive error messages and troubleshooting

### 4. Maintainability âœ…
- Centralized command logic
- Easy to update and extend
- Clear usage examples and documentation

### 5. Documentation âœ…
- Comprehensive guides for all operations
- Clear migration path from old commands
- Best practices and troubleshooting guides

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing

All control scripts include:
- Environment validation
- Container health checks
- Comprehensive error handling
- Built-in help systems

### Manual Testing

The following scenarios have been tested:
- Fresh environment setup
- WordPress installation and configuration

   - Standardized database backup/restore
   - Migration management
   - Query optimization tools

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Resource usage tracking
   - Performance optimization tools
   - Automated performance testing

3. **Advanced Debugging**
   - Profiling tools
   - Memory leak detection
   - Performance bottleneck identification

## Conclusion

The control script enforcement implementation has been successfully completed, providing:

- **Comprehensive Coverage** - All common operations now use control scripts
- **Excellent Documentation** - Clear guides and examples for all operations
- **Robust Error Handling** - Built-in validation and troubleshooting
- **Future-Proof Architecture** - Easy to extend and maintain

This implementation ensures that the WP QR Trackr project maintains its dependency minimization goals while providing developers with powerful, standardized tools for all their development needs.
