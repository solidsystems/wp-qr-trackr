## How to Use This Plan

- Assign your name to a task when you start working on it.
- Update the status as you make progress: â¬œ Not started, ðŸŸ¨ In progress, âœ… Complete.
- Add new automation ideas as needed!

# QR Trackr Plugin: Stability & Quality Project Plan

## 1. Automated Testing & Coverage
**Priority: Highest**
- Expand PHPUnit coverage: Audit current tests; add/expand unit and integration tests for all modules, especially business logic and database migrations.
- Set up code coverage reporting (e.g., Xdebug + PHPUnit, or pcov).
- Add a minimum coverage threshold in CI (fail if coverage drops).
- Add E2E/UI tests (Playwright/Cypress): In dev container only, automate admin and user flows (QR code creation, scan tracking, settings). Run E2E tests in CI (dev image only).

## 2. Static Analysis & Security
**Priority: High**
- Integrate PHPStan or Psalm: Add to dev dependencies, configure for WordPress, and run in CI. Fix or baseline existing issues; fail CI on new ones.
- Dependency & security scanning: Add `composer audit` and (if applicable) `npm audit` to CI. Integrate WPScan or similar for WordPress-specific vulnerabilities.

## 3. Performance & Caching
**Priority: High**
- Profile plugin load and queries: Add scripts or tools to measure plugin load time and DB query count. Set up alerts/warnings in CI if performance degrades.
- Enforce caching best practices: Audit code for use of transients/object cache for expensive operations.

## 4. Database Migration & Upgrade Safety
**Priority: High**
- Automate migration tests: Test plugin activation, deactivation, and upgrades in CI. Use versioned migration scripts and test rollback.
- Backward compatibility matrix: Test against multiple WordPress and PHP versions in CI.

## 5. Documentation & Changelog Automation
**Priority: Medium**
- Automate changelog generation: Use tools (e.g., `github-changelog-generator`, `release-drafter`) to update `CHANGELOG.md` from PRs/commits.
- Enforce inline documentation: Add PHPCS or custom checks for docblock presence and quality.

## 6. Release & Deployment Automation
**Priority: Medium**
- Automate release tagging and packaging: Tag releases in GitHub; automate packaging and (if public) push to WordPress.org.
- Validate release assets: Ensure only intended files are included in release zips.

## 7. Error Monitoring & Debugging
**Priority: Medium**
- Centralized error logging: Integrate with OpenSearch, Sentry, or similar for error/exception tracking.
- Debug toggles: Ensure debug logging can be enabled/disabled via env or WP options.

## 8. Accessibility & UX
**Priority: Medium**
- Automated accessibility checks: Use tools (axe, pa11y) to check admin and frontend UI.
- Mobile/responsive UI tests: Automate checks for mobile-first compliance.

## 9. CI/CD Best Practices
**Priority: Ongoing**
- Fail fast and parallelize: Ensure all scripts use `set -e` and CI jobs run in parallel where possible.
- Matrix builds: Continue/expand testing across PHP and WordPress versions.

## 10. Team Workflow & PR Automation
**Priority: Ongoing**
- Pre-merge checklists: Use PR templates to enforce review, test, and doc requirements.
- Automated reviewer assignment: Use GitHub Actions or bots for code ownership and review rotation.
