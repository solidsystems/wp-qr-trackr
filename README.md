## Local Development with Docker

You can run this WordPress plugin template locally using Docker. This will spin up both a WordPress instance and a MySQL database, making it easy to test your plugin in a real environment.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/docker-explained) must be installed on your system. If you need help, see this guide: [How To Install and Use Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-mac-os-x).

### Steps
1. **Copy the example environment file:**
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to set your local secrets if needed
   ```
2. **Initialize the Docker environment:**
   ```sh
   ./scripts/init-docker.sh
   ```
   This script will check if port 8080 is free, stop any Docker container using it, and start the environment.

3. **Access WordPress:**
   - Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
   - Complete the WordPress setup wizard if prompted.

4. **Develop Your Plugin:**
   - Place your plugin code in `wp-content/plugins` (mounted automatically).
   - Activate and test your plugin from the WordPress admin panel.

### Stopping the Environment
To stop the containers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running Docker, or run:
```sh
docker-compose down
```

## QR Code Shapes (Extensible)

QR Trackr now supports a `shape` parameter for QR code generation. By default, only the standard shape is available, but the Pro plugin (or other plugins) can register new shapes and custom QR code renderers.

### Usage
- The `qr_trackr_generate_qr_image` and `qr_trackr_generate_qr_image_for_link` functions accept a `$shape` parameter.
- Use the `qr_trackr_get_available_shapes()` function to get all registered shapes.

### Extending with Pro
- Pro or other plugins can add new shapes via the `qr_trackr_qr_shapes` filter:

```php
add_filter('qr_trackr_qr_shapes', function($shapes) {
    $shapes['animal_head'] = __('Animal Head', 'qr-trackr-pro');
    return $shapes;
});
```

- To generate custom QR code images for new shapes, use the `qr_trackr_generate_custom_shape` filter:

```php
add_filter('qr_trackr_generate_custom_shape', function($custom, $url, $size, $shape, $filepath) {
    if ($shape === 'animal_head') {
        // Generate and save custom QR code to $filepath
        // ...
        return true; // Indicate handled
    }
    return $custom;
}, 10, 5);
```

- If the filter returns `null`, the core plugin will fall back to the standard QR code.

---

## Pro Version

The Pro add-on can:
- Register new shapes and custom QR code renderers.
- Provide advanced QR code styles, overlays, and more.
- Integrate with the shape system via the documented filters.

See the Pro plugin documentation for more details.

## Xdebug Installation on macOS (ARM & x86)

### Why This Script is Needed
On macOS, especially with Homebrew-managed PHP installations (both Apple Silicon/ARM and Intel/x86), PECL sometimes fails to install extensions like Xdebug due to symlinked directories. Homebrew creates a symlink for the `pecl` directory (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/php/8.4.8/pecl`), which points to a shared location (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/lib/php/pecl`). When PECL tries to create subdirectories for extensions, it may encounter errors if the directory already exists or if there are permission issues, resulting in errors like:

```
Warning: mkdir(): File exists in System.php on line 294
ERROR: failed to mkdir /opt/homebrew/Cellar/php/8.4.8/pecl/20240924
```

This affects both ARM (Apple Silicon) and x86 (Intel) Macs using Homebrew.

### How It Was Fixed
The `fix-pecl-xdebug.sh` script:
- Checks that the `pecl` path is a symlink.
- Ensures the target directory exists and has the correct permissions.
- Attempts to install Xdebug via PECL.
- Falls back to Homebrew installation if PECL fails.

### Usage
1. Make the script executable:
   ```sh
   chmod +x fix-pecl-xdebug.sh
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   ./fix-pecl-xdebug.sh
   ```

This script is compatible with both ARM and x86 Homebrew installations. It should be included as part of the standard setup for local development on macOS.

## Infrastructure & Project Plumbing

This section explains the underlying infrastructure, dependencies, and how everything fits together so anyone can run the project from scratch.

### Core Components
- **Homebrew**: Used for installing system dependencies (macOS).
- **PHP**: The main runtime for WordPress and the plugin. Installed via Homebrew.
- **Yarn**: JavaScript package manager for frontend/admin assets. Required for building and managing JS dependencies.
- **Composer**: PHP dependency manager. Used for installing PHP libraries and tools (e.g., PHPUnit).
- **Xdebug**: PHP extension for debugging and code coverage. Installed via PECL/Homebrew, with setup scripts to fix common macOS issues.

### Cloud & Platform Integrations
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: The recommended deployment target. Ensures compatibility for cloud hosting.
- **DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL**: Used for plugin data storage and analytics.
- **OpenSearch (DigitalOcean Managed)**: For forwarding and searching system logs.

### Project Scripts & Automation
- **setup-macos.sh**: One-step setup for macOS (ARM & x86). Installs Homebrew, PHP, Xdebug, and runs all required fixes.
- **fix-pecl-xdebug.sh**: Ensures Xdebug installs cleanly with Homebrew PHP/PECL on macOS.
- **create-github-project-tasks.sh**: Automates project board population for GitHub Projects.

### Environment Variables
- All required environment variables are documented in `.env.example`. Copy this to `.env` and fill in your values.

### How It All Fits Together
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Run the setup script** (`./setup-macos.sh`) to install all system dependencies and fix PHP/Xdebug issues.
3. **Install JS dependencies** with `yarn install`.
4. **Install PHP dependencies** with `composer install`.
5. **Set up your environment** by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and filling in any required secrets or connection strings (e.g., PostgreSQL, OpenSearch).
6. **Run tests** to verify your environment: `./vendor/bin/phpunit`.
7. **Start Docker for local WordPress:**
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```

### Required Components & How They're Enforced
- **Scripts check for required tools** (Homebrew, PHP, Yarn, Composer) and prompt to install if missing.
- **.env.example** lists all required environment variables; setup scripts can check for their presence.
- **CI/CD pipelines** (planned) will verify that all dependencies are installed and configured before allowing merges.

### Troubleshooting
- If you hit issues with Xdebug or PECL, always run `fix-pecl-xdebug.sh`.
- For database or logging issues, check your `.env` values and DigitalOcean service status.
